            Java Threads
            Threads allows a program to operate more efficiently by doing multiple things at the same time.

            Threads can be used to perform complicated tasks in the background without 
            interrupting the main program.

            Creating a Thread
            There are two ways to create a thread.

            It can be created by extending the Thread class and overriding its run() method:
        */

        


    }
}
